//The application state is a plain object constrained by static typing.
//It can contain arbitrary information, but you should avoid redundancies
//and keep it serializable.

//Not to put in state:
//Derived State: Anything you can compute from the existing state doesnâ€™t need to be in the state - even if the computation is expensive.
//Local State: if some state is only relevant to one component, manage it locally.
